        <p>
          In January of 1993, a preliminary injunction is filed in the Denver
          District Court because the measure appeared to endorse discrimination.
          This injunction delays the amendment from being enforced and will take
          the grievance to the state supreme court.
        </p>

        <p>
          In July of 1993, the Colorado Supreme Court voted 6 to 1, saying that
          Amendment 2 would prohibit the legal protection of homosexuals
          specifically, forcing them to be
          <span>“fence[ed] out” from the political process.</span> However, this
          ruling included that the measure could be passed if it proved a
          “compelling state interest”. This state interest was argued further to
          promote “family values” by the Colorado Attorney General Norton.
        </p>

        <p>
          On December 15th, 1993, the measure was struck down by Judge Jefferey
          Bayless, saying that
          <span
            >the state interest to promote family values is only valid if it was
            not at the expense of another group.</span
          >This was a warning to other states who were trying to pass similar
          measures.
        </p>

        <p>
          In October of 1994, the measure goes to the Colorado Supreme Court for
          the last time, being deemed as <span>unconstitutional,</span> and is
          appealed to the United States Supreme Court.
        </p>

        <p>
          On October 10th, 1995, the case Romer v. Evans was taken up in the
          United States Supreme Court. On May 20th, 1996, the court’s opinion
          was that Colorado’s Amendment 2 was <span>unconstitutional.</span>
        </p>

        <h2 class="quote">
          "This is the most important victory ever for lesbian and gay rights"
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Ms. Goldberg, a member of the legal team striking down Amendment 2.
        </h3>

        <p>
          The court’s majority opinion was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy,
          along with John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O’Connor, David Souter, Ruth
          Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer. This opinion had different
          reasoning than Colorado’s Supreme Court, saying that the amendment was
          unconstitutional based on its <span>animosity</span> toward
          homosexuals without any rational reason.
        </p>

        <p>
          Justice Kennedy’s opinion of the Court, where it was stated that the
          Constitution’s “words now are understood to state a commitment to the
          law’s neutrality where the rights of persons are at stake” conflicts
          these traditional values.
        </p>

        <p>
          A scathing dissenting opinion was written by Justice Antonin Scalia,
          along with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Clarence
          Thomas. This dissent noted the decision 10 years earlier with Bowers
          v. Hardwick, stating that “If it is rational to criminalize the
          conduct, surely it is rational to deny special favor and protection to
          those with a self-avowed tendency or desire to engage in the conduct.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Justice Scalia in his dissent lauded this amendment as a way to
          “preserve traditional sexual mores”, and using the law as a tool to
          “revise those mores through use of the laws”.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the US Supreme Court, dissents have been historically apologetic,
          mainly because
          <span
            >disagreeing with the court means that a Justice is going against a
            generally agreed consensus.</span
          >
          Because of this apologetic nature, most justices end their dissents
          with “I respectfully dissent.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Justice Scalia did not follow this trend, being frank when he says in
          the middle of his dissent “I vigorously dissent”, and finishing his
          dissent off with <span>“I dissent”</span>, signaling that he was very
          apprehensive about the Court’s decision.
